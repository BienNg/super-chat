# Manager's Guide to Database Performance Dashboard

## 🎯 What This Dashboard Does

This **Database Performance Monitor** helps you understand how your app uses its database in real-time. It tracks every interaction with your data and shows you costs, performance, and potential issues - all in simple, non-technical terms.

## 🚀 How to Access the Dashboard

**Look for the status indicator** in the top-right corner of your screen:

- **Green dot** = Normal activity
- **Blue dot** = Moderate activity  
- **Orange dot** = High activity (needs attention)
- **Red dot** = Critical issues

**Click the status indicator** to open the full dashboard.
