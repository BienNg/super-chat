# Firestore Quota Exceeded - Emergency Fixes Applied

## Issue
The application was hitting Firebase Firestore's quota limits due to excessive onSnapshot listeners, causing the error:
```
[code=resource-exhausted]: Quota exceeded
Using maximum backoff delay to prevent overloading the backend
```

## Root Cause
Multiple concurrent onSnapshot listeners were creating a cascade of database requests:

1. **TaskCard components** - Each had individual onSnapshot listeners for reply counts
2. **useChannelFiles** - Real-time listener for all messages with attachments  
3. **useMessageReactions** - Real-time listener for all reactions
4. **useBookmarks** - Real-time listener for all bookmarks
5. **Debugging logs** - Console logs on every render/effect adding overhead

## Emergency Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fixed - TaskCard Performance
- **Problem**: Each TaskCard had its own onSnapshot listener for reply counts
- **Fix**: Use cached reply count from task data instead of live queries
- **Impact**: Reduces listeners from N tasks to 0

### ✅ Fixed - Channel Files  
- **Problem**: Real-time onSnapshot listener for messages with attachments
- **Fix**: Changed to getDocs() - load once when needed
- **Impact**: Reduces from continuous listening to on-demand loading

### ✅ Fixed - Message Reactions
- **Problem**: Real-time listener for all reactions in channel
- **Fix**: Temporarily disabled - returns empty reactions
- **Impact**: Eliminates constant reaction listening

### ✅ Fixed - Bookmarks
- **Problem**: Real-time listener for all user bookmarks  
- **Fix**: Temporarily disabled - returns empty bookmarks
- **Impact**: Eliminates bookmark listening overhead

### ✅ Fixed - Debug Logging
- **Problem**: Console.log statements on every render/effect
- **Fix**: Removed all debugging logs from TaskDetails, TaskThread, useThreadReplies
- **Impact**: Reduces CPU overhead and memory usage

## Current Status
The core functionality (messages, tasks, threading) should now work without hitting quota limits.

## Temporarily Disabled Features
- Real-time message reactions (will show empty)
- Real-time bookmarks (will show empty) 
- Real-time file updates (manual refresh needed)

## Next Steps (After Quota Resets)
1. **Implement connection pooling** - Share listeners between components
2. **Add request batching** - Group multiple operations  
3. **Use pagination** - Limit data loaded at once
4. **Implement caching** - Reduce redundant requests
5. **Re-enable disabled features** with optimized patterns

## Monitoring
- Monitor Firebase console for quota usage
- Watch for any remaining performance issues
- Test task messaging functionality

## Timeline  
- **Immediate**: Core messaging should work
- **1 hour**: Firebase quotas may reset
- **Next session**: Implement permanent optimizations
