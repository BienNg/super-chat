# Thread Preview Width Consistency Fix

## Problem Identified

The original ThreadPreview component had inconsistent widths that created a poor user experience:

- **Short preview messages** resulted in narrow thread previews
- **Long preview messages** resulted in wide thread previews that took up excessive space
- **Inconsistent layout** made it difficult for users to scan messages efficiently
- **Poor visual hierarchy** where thread previews competed with main message content

## Solution Implemented

### üéØ **Consistent Width & Height**
- **Fixed max-width**: 400px for all thread previews
- **Minimum height**: 60px ensures uniform appearance
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to smaller screens while maintaining consistency

### üìê **Improved Layout Structure**
```css
.thread-preview-button {
    max-width: 400px;        /* Consistent max width */
    min-height: 60px;        /* Consistent min height */
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    gap: 12px;
}

.thread-preview-content {
    max-width: 240px;        /* Fixed content area width */
}

.thread-preview-reply-content {
    max-width: 200px;        /* Consistent truncation */
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    white-space: nowrap;
}
```

### üé® **Enhanced Visual Design**
- **Better spacing**: Improved padding and margins
- **Proper truncation**: Long content is truncated with ellipsis
- **Smooth animations**: Fade-in effect when thread previews appear
- **Hover states**: Clear visual feedback on interaction

### üîß **Technical Improvements**
- **CSS classes**: Moved from inline Tailwind to dedicated CSS classes
- **Flex layout**: Better control over element positioning
- **Responsive breakpoints**: Mobile-friendly adjustments
- **Accessibility**: Focus states and proper ARIA support
